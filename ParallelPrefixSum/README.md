An implementation of Ladner-Fischer parallel prefix sum.

This algorithm parallelizes the scan operation, which given a sequence of numbers produces a sequence of progressive sums of the input.

This program, specifically, generates simple, nonrandom integer data sufficient to demonstrate the function of the prefix sum algorithm, and measures the algorithm's runtime with a fixed number of threads.

The makefile command builds an executable that runs the program.
